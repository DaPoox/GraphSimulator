# GraphSimulator
The project goal is to write a program to dynamically present the execution of an algorithm on a graph.
1- Draw a graph.
2- Edit the graph.
3- Choose an algorithm to launch.
4- Run the algorithm and watch it step by step (The running speed can be controlled by the user).

The program was made using JavaFx.
